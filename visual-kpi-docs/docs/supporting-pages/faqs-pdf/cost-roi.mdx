    <Accordion title="1. How is the system priced? What is the rough cost I should expect?">
      You can find all of the details about our pricing model and options at <a href="https://transpara.com/pricing">https://transpara.com/pricing</a>. We offer multiple tiers of features, including Pro, Enterprise, and Enterprise ADI, and within each tier it is priced by the number of users who will access the system (named or concurrent users).

    <Accordion title="2. What licensing models do you support?">
      Transpara offers a range of licensing models, with the default being annual subscription licenses with a 3-year term. Additional discounts apply to longer term commitments. We also offer various custom licenses including site, corporate and enterprise licenses or volume-based licenses.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="3. What are your license terms?">
      You can review our license and service terms & conditions <a href="https://www.transpara.com/license-and-service-terms/">here</a>.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="4. Do you offer volume discounts or discounts for multi-year licenses?">
      Yes. We have volume price breaks as the number of users increases, and we offer additional discounts for longer-term commitments.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="5. Can I upgrade or change my license?">
      Yes! We support expansion or changes to your license at any time, including changing plans or models, adding users, and other changes. Just reach out to us if you want to make changes.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="6. What happens if I go over my license volume temporarily?">
      Transpara's licenses contain a Fair Use Policy because we understand that critical events occur from time-to-time and you should never be trapped during a crisis. We don't place hard limitations in the software, so if you need to share information with someone who isn't a licensed user, or go beyond the number of licenses you own, we are ok with that. It is only when you repeatedly or consistently violate the terms of your license do we need to increase your license or upgrade your plan. Our goal is to always be a trusted partner and a tool you can count on in a crisis.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="7. How do I estimate ROI? What are the core factors to look at and how long should it take?">
      Overall, the ROI of any real-time operations and analytics platform will depend on how it is implemented, what use cases and data it surfaces, and the users that leverage it. While Transpara improves decision making, productivity, collaboration and the extracted value of existing investments, each of our customers achieves ROI in their own way. Because of this, we worked with our many customers to create a comprehensive ROI Guide which is available <a href="https://www.transpara.com/roi-justification-guide-ebook/">here</a>.
