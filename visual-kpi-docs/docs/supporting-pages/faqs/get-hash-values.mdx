If your organization's IT governance has strict requirements for ensuring that our installation media have not been altered, you can contact us at support@transpara.com. We will be happy to provide you with the relevant MD5 or SHA checksum to validate any Visual KPI build that you require.

## Why checksums matter

MD5 (or SHA-1, SHA256, , SHA512, ccHas64) are mathematical functions that originated in the cryptography discipline. It's a long string of digits that gets computed by reading the binary executable we make.

Transpara uses a string of digits as a ["checksum"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checksum) to ensure the integrity of its downloadable executables. You can find this string of digits on our website along with the downloadable .exe file. Once you download the file, you can run an MD5 or SHA hash checker on it and compare the generated string with the one on our website. If the strings match, you can be confident that the file you are installing is the same as the one we posted online.

It's important to ensure that the files you place on your computer are safe and haven't been tampered with by someone else. A checksum is a way to guarantee that a file has not been modified to be harmful by a third party before it reaches your computer. While you can trust Transpara, it's a good idea to check that no one else has intercepted the files while they were being transferred over the internet.
