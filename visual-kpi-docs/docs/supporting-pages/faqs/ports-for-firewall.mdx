The default ports are 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS, but you can configure any ports you wish in IIS.

If an interface is separated from its endpoint connection, the port used by the interface must be opened between the Transpara Web server and the data source.

For example, if you're using OSIsoft PI as the data source and there's a firewall between the Transpara Web server and PI server(s), you'll need to open port 5450 to allow inbound traffic to OSI PI coming from our use of the PI or AF SDK.
