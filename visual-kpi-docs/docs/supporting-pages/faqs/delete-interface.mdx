Visual KPI will not allow you to delete an interface when you have associated data. If you're trying to delete an interface via Visual KPI Server Manager, you may get a message that looks like this:
```
  Interface [interface name] is referenced and cannot be deleted.
```

Deleting an interface in Visual KPI requires removing all associated data, including KPIs, Charts, and Trends, before using Visual KPI Server Manager.
