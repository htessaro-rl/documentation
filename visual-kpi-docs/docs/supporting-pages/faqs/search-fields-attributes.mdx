The Visual KPI search function provides a comprehensive search result of dashboards, groups, KPIs, charts, and tables that match with your input. It returns results in real-time, along with the status of KPIs and groups that contain KPIs. 

So what attributes the search function uses to generate results?

| Field          | Attributes                      |
|----------------|---------------------------------|
| **Dashboards** | name, description.              |
| **Groups**     | name, description.              |
| **KPIs**       | name, description, actual lookups (tags, equations, etc.) |
| **Charts**     | name, description.              |
| **Tables**     | name, description.              |
| **Trends**     | pen names, pen lookups.         |
