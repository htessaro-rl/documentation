Not at this time. Visual KPI Groups are designed to have one active Dashboard per Group, with the exception of the Home group, which already has this Dashboard feature available.

We are developing a feature that will enable seamless navigation between Dashboards, similar to Group to Group navigation.

Learn more about [Visual KPI Groups](/docs/end-user/features/groups).
