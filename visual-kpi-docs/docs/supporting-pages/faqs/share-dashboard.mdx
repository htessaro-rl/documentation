Yes, and you have multiple options for linking to dashboards:

- Create several dashboards in the same profile and use the pulldown menu to choose the one you want to view.
- Add a link via Customize Dashboard.
- Pin a link to the Bookmark Bar.

To learn more about each of these options to Customize Your Visual KPI Dashboard, refer to the [Dashboard](/docs/end-user/basic-navigation/dashboards) page of the Basic Navigation guide.
