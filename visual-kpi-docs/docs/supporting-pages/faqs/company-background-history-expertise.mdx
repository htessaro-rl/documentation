    <Accordion title="Why is Transpara the right company to be doing this? What is your background?">
      We have deep software and industrial backgrounds, with team members coming from the likes of Microsoft, OSIsoft, Honeywell, Accenture, and Aspen Tech. This is the third software company we've created, and we have a particular passion for productized solutions. With 500+ public releases under our belts, you get to benefit from all that rigor, even if you're not using Transpara in a hardcore, industrial environment.
