You can embed a Visual KPI screen in a browser menu to display only real-time data, hiding other navigation elements and page elements. To do this you need to add the word `embed` into the URL of the selected Visual KPI screen. 

Using the URL below as example:
```
https://demo.transpara.com/PowerGen?pid=0
```

Adding `embed` it would become the following URL:
```
http://demo.transpara.com/PowerGen/embed?pid=0
```
