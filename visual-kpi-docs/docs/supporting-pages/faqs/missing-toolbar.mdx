Certain combinations of Microsoft Windows, Microsoft Office, and VSTO Runtime may cause the Visual KPI Designer toolbar to disappear from the Document Actions pane.

Here are some possible solutions to fix the issue you're experiencing with Visual KPI Designer. We recommend starting with [Solution 1](#solution-1-optimize-microsoft-excel) and after applying each fix, restart your computer and reopen the program. If one solution works, then you're good to go. However, if the issue still persists, then try the next solution.
