Sometimes you need to quickly share a specific dashboard with a colleague or create a link to a dashboard for the bookmark bar or another dashboard. For most objects in Visual KPI, the URL address in your browser will work, but dashboards are a bit different:

- Dashboards have a specific URL in your browser that looks something like this: http://demo.transpara.com/tandd/?pid=0, where “?pid-0” means “the dashboard” but not a specific dashboard. This is because Visual KPI remembers what dashboard the user was last using, or goes to the default dashboard if this is the first visit from a browser.
- Because of the above, if you want to share a specific dashboard or get its exact URL you need to use the share button (for users) or get the dashboard ID in the Visual KPI Designer (for admins).
- A specific dashboard link will include the ID and look like this: http://demo.transpara.com/tandd/?pid=0&dashid=de1bfb47-efa3-4f1a-b9f6-eae566317ff1

You can find the URL link to a specific dashboard, KPI, or any page you are viewing via the Share button. If you are an administrator, you can also get the link to a specific dashboard from the GUID in Visual KPI Designer.

## Link to a specific dashboard via Share

To link to a specific dashboard via Share, follow the steps below:

1. Click the **Share button** on the Visual KPI navigation bar to get the URL of any page you are viewing.

<StylizedImage
  imgURL="img/faqs/share-link-dashboard1.png"
  alt=""
/>

2. Use **Copy to Clipboard** to copy and then paste the dashboard link into any application.

:::note
The Email option opens your email account with a pre-populated message that automatically includes the specific URL to the fashboard or page you are currently viewing.
