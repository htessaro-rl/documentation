Yes, it is possible to print and save your dashboards and reports from Visual KPI in PDF format. This can be done easily by using third-party tools like [HTML TO PDF Converter](https://www.html-to-pdf.net/). These tools are capable of converting complex HTML pages, such as those in Visual KPI, into properly formatted PDF files. Printing or saving to PDF directly from your web browser often results in unprofessional formatting. To avoid this issue, use HTML to PDF conversion softwares instead.

:::tip Pro tip
Make sure to test different settings, such as **Delay before conversion** to allow the page to fully load before converting.
