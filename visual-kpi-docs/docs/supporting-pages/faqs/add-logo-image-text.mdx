You have the flexibility to add a wide range of items to your Dashboard, such as KPIs, charts, trends, [embedded content](/docs/end-user/features/visualizations/charts) from external sources, groups/hierarchies, and more. Additionally, you can personalize your Dashboard by including [custom logos and other images](/docs/end-user/features/dashboards). You can [add labels, static text, and dynamic objects](/docs/end-user/features/dashboards) from data sources using [Visual KPI Interfaces](/docs/setup-and-administration/interfaces).

Here is a few examples:

- Show a safety message to all users (static, or pull a dynamic message from a data source).
- Show a dynamic text value, such as which batch is currently running or what product you are currently producing.
- Show a dynamic value, such as a price or temperature.
- Show a diagram, logo, or another custom image in a resizeable widget anywhere on the dashboard.
