Google Chrome automatically enables touch events on touch-enabled devices. This means Chrome will override the mouse (or touchpad) for some types of events. If you are using Google Chrome on a touchscreen device and cannot see the cursor, you may need to disable touch events.

To use the cursor (and a mouse or touchpad) on your Visual KPI site so you can drag it for things like box zoom on a trend, disable Touch Events or Touch API (depending on your version of Chrome), do the following:

1. Open Google Chrome.
2. In the URL address bar type `chrome://flags/` and press Enter.
3. Click **Enable touch events > Disabled**.

On iOS, you wonâ€™t see a cursor, but you can use Visual KPI draw/drag tools when you disable drag and drop. To perform this, do these steps:

1. Open Google Chrome.
2. In the URL address bar type `chrome://flags/` and press Enter.
3. Set **Drag and Drop** to **Disabled**.

You may need to relaunch your browser for the new setting to take effect.
