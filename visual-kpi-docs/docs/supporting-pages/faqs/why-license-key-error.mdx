If you encounter a license key error message that says "Failed to save license key" while attempting to add your license key in Visual KPI Server Manager, it's likely due to the logged-in user lacking write permissions in SQL Server for the Visual KPI database.

To resolve this issue, consider the following steps:

1. **Check Permissions**: Ensure that you have the necessary permissions assigned to you. If not, request the appropriate access rights from your system administrator.

2. **Delegate the Task**: Alternatively, if you don't have the required permissions, ask someone with the necessary access rights to apply the Visual KPI license key within Visual KPI Server Manager.
