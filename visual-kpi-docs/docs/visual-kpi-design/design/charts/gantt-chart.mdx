Gantt charts are an excellent way to track projects in Visual KPI. They are a type of bar chart that can show project schedules, dependencies, and status. You can Configure Gantt charts using Visual KPI Designer.

Using a Gantt chart, you can show all of a project's elements along a timeline, when each element is scheduled to be completed, any dependencies, and the status of each. Task or project elements are listed along the Gantt chart's vertical axis, and the horizontal axis displays time intervals. Gantt charts are particularly useful in Visual KPI because they can display status.

## Define Gantt Chart Attributes

After creating and configuring some basic attributes for a chart, you can design how the Gantt chart looks. Here, we show you the basic attributes you need to set to design a basic Gantt chart. To see all possible attributes you can configure, see [Charts Attributes & Keywords Reference Guide](/docs/visual-kpi-design/reference-tables/charts-reference).

You can also use queries and Connect Strings to connect to an SQL database.
