The Visual KPI Designer is a tool specifically designed for creators and administrators who are responsible for setting up, configuring, and managing the Visual KPI website's backend. It is essentially a configuration hub where data sources are linked, KPIs are defined, and the hierarchical structure of the data is organized. It is aimed at users who need to manipulate and prepare the data presentations without directly interacting with the end-user interface of the Visual KPI site. On the other hand, the Visual KPI site is the front-end interface accessed by end users and displays the data visualizations that have been configured in the Visual KPI Designer. 

The Visual KPI Designer is an add-on tool for Microsoft Excel, designed to simplify the process of setting up and managing Visual KPI websites. This tool is especially user-friendly for those already familiar with Excel, as it operates within the Excel interface. It is compatible with Excel versions from 2007 onwards, though it works best with versions 2013 or 2016.

When users make changes or input data in Excel using the Designer, these changes aren't immediately updated on the Visual KPI website. Instead, the data is saved within Excel and then manually uploaded to the Visual KPI server when the user is ready {/*check this info*/}. This ensures that any changes being made don't disrupt the ongoing operations of the Visual KPI site, allowing for uninterrupted access and analysis of real-time data. 

At its core, the Visual KPI Designer doesn't create or store the operational data itself. It's more about organizing and presenting the data. Users can set up how they want their data to be displayed on their Visual KPI site, like showing sales figures in a specific format or for a particular time frame.
