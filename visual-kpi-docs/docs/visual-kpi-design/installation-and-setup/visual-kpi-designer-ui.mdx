Once installed, Visual KPI Designer appears as an extra set of tools within Excel, tailored for creating and managing KPIs, charts, and tables for your Visual KPI website. When you open Excel after installing the Visual KPI Designer, you'll notice a new section or toolbar dedicated to Visual KPI functions, indicating that it's ready to use. The worksheet toolbar in Visual KPI Designer provides specific controls to manage data within your Excel sheets:

1. **Select all**: Places an x in the column for each populated row in the active worksheet.
2. **Unselect all**: Removes all x from the column for each populated row in the active worksheet.
3. **Close worksheet**: Closes the active worksheet.
4. **Close all worksheets but this**: Closes all open worksheets, except the active worksheet.
5. **Close all worksheets**: Closes all open worksheets (except the default Visual KPI Designer worksheet).
6. **Refresh metadata**: Refreshes the contents of the drop-down lists in the opened worksheets.
7. **Toggle basic and advanced modes**: Hides or shows advanced columns. When working in Basic Mode, you see fewer columns.
8. **Toggle context help**: Hides or shows the tooltips that appear when you click on cells. You can show tooltips only for header cells or for all cells.
9. **Site settings**: Access the sitewide settings menu to access Profiles & Dashboards/Website.
10. **Session record**: Displays a list of all activities that have occurred between the KPI Designer and the server since the Visual KPI Designer was last opened.

In the Visual KPI Designer, you'll work with different object types. Basically, categories of data like Groups, KPIs, Charts, and Tables. Each of these represents a different aspect of your Visual KPI website. For example, if you want to create or edit a KPI, you'll select the KPI object type, which will open a new worksheet customized for KPIs. 

The Object Toolbar in the Visual KPI Designer changes depending on which type of data, or object, you're working with. For instance, when you're dealing with KPIs, the toolbar will show options relevant to KPIs. You may see any of these icons for a given worksheet:

1. **Create a new object**: Opens a new worksheet for each object (Groups, KPIs, Charts, Tables).
2. **Open a object**: Opens an existing object.
3. Save all selected objects in a worksheet: In the Visual KPI Designer, you do not save an Excel spreadsheet. **You save using this icon.** It will save any object rows marked with an x. This writes the data to the server.
4. **Preview updates**: Shows a preview for saving all changes of the selected objects. This can take a long time if there are many items marked in the worksheet.
5. **Membership of selected objects**: Adds a new worksheet called Membership, which displays all of the selected items and the Groups to which they belong. This can be a lengthy process if there are many items selected in the worksheet.
6. **Load/Refresh selected objects**: Updates data spreadsheet to reflect current data saved on the Visual KPI site.
7. **Delete selected objects**: The delete icon will erase all selected objects from the spreadsheet and from the server.

:::info Deleting objects

Make sure you want to delete the selected objects, because you will erase all selected objects from the spreadsheet and from the server.

### Visual KPI Designer worksheets

If you are using a new installation of Visual KPI Designer, you'll notice that much of the setup has already been added for you. You can just start adding KPIs and they'll show up immediately in your Visual KPI website. When entering data, you can enter text much like you would in any Excel worksheet. You simply type the data into a cell.

Rows in Excel represent Visual KPI items or objects. Each column represents an attribute. You enter a new KPI, for example, on a row. As you scroll along the columns, you set its attributes. This concept applies to every type of worksheet in the Visual KPI Designer. For example, if you are working on profiles, each row is a profile, and each column represents an attribute for that profile. Additionally, the Visual KPI Designer includes contextual help within the Excel spreadsheet. Rows, columns and cells may have tooltips or descriptions to help you understand how to configure data.

You'll see tabs at the bottom of Excel showing any open worksheets, and you always have a Visual KPI Designer worksheet open. This is the worksheet that opens when you open the Visual KPI Designer, it is a blank worksheet and allows you to start entering KPI data immediately or you can open existing data using the [Visual KPI Tab Tools](www.google.com). To select an active worksheet, click any worksheet tab at the bottom of Excel.

Sometimes you can select data from a list. When you select a cell, if it supports a selection list, it shows a drop-down arrow indicating you can select from a list. Click the drop-down arrow to display the contents of the list. Make a selection from the list to place the text in the cell.
