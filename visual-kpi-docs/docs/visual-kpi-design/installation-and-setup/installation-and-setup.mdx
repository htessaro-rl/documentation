The Visual KPI Designer is already set up with basic configuration. You can configure your Visual KPI website with your company branding and details, add a few KPIs and have your website ready in minutes.

Of course, there are many configurations you can control using the Visual KPI Designer, but this Visual KPI Quick Start guide will help you configure your Visual KPI website before you start adding KPIs.

## Contextual help

Tooltips and descriptions are designed to help you use the worksheet. For example, in the Web Site configuration worksheet, the description for Site Title, tells you that whatever you enter here will show up in the title bar on the website.

## Website worksheet

The Visual KPI Designer Web Site Configuration worksheet is used to edit basic, default settings to configure your Visual KPI sites. Click the Site Settings icon (add icon) under Document Actions to access the sitewide settings menu to access **Profiles & Dashboards** and **Website**. You can choose to keep any of the default settings, but here we will present some basics configurations you may want to set up immediately:

### Site title

The default Value is Transpara Visual KPI. Change this to reflect your website's name as displayed in the title bar.

1. In the Site Title row of the worksheet, click the Value column.
2. Enter your site's title.
3. Click the Save icon (add icon) in the Web Site configuration toolbar.

### Site logo

The default Logo is from Transpara Visual KPI, but you can easily change it.

1. Click the Upload Logo icon (add icon) in the Web Site Configuration toolbar.
2. Browse and select an image file (JPG or PNG) of your logo. Click Open.
3. Click the Save icon (add icon) in the Web Site configuration toolbar.

:::note Logo Size

If the logo file does not match the required size (140 x 40 pixels), the image will be forced into the specified size, causing some distortion in the image's appearance.

### Admin information

Choose the contact for your Visual KPI site. This will appear in some System Configuration pages on your site. It will also be used for cache server error notifications.

1. In the Site Administrator Contact row, select the Value cell.
2. Use the pulldown menu to select the appropriate contact.

### Cache warning

If you want to receive notifications of issues relating to the Cache, follow the instructions below.

1. Use the pulldown menu to select a notification method in the Cache Alert Notification Protocol field. When set to None, notifications will not be sent out.
2. Enter a value in the Cache Alert Reminder Interval (minutes) field indicating the frequency to be used for sending out cache alert reminders. When the value is 0, the Cache Alert Reminders will not be sent.
3. Enter a value in the Cache Warning Interval (minutes) field. When the value is 0, the Cache Warning is disabled.
