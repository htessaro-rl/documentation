Visual KPI Designer enables you to configure contacts that can be referenced in your KPI data, allowing you to quickly determine who to contact regarding a specific set of data. Once you've created and saved a contact, it becomes available in the Contact pull-down lists within the Groups, KPIs, Charts and Tables worksheets in Visual KPI Designer.  Additionally, you can define the types of alerts to be sent using Alert Templates. You can decide what type of information should be included in the alert email and the intervals at when alerts will be sent.

### Contacts

Open the Configure Contacts worksheet by clicking the Sitewide Settings configuration icon (add icon) and select **Contacts & Alerts** and then **Contacts**.

To add a new contact, add a **Name** on the first blank row below the column headers, add a **Description** if appropriate, enter one or multiple **Contact Names**, **Contact Emails** and **Contact Phones**. If you want to enter multiple names, emails or phones, just separate them with semicolons. Then, place an **x** in the first column for the new contact. Click the **Save** button to write the changes to the database.

When you click the **Membership Of Selected Contacts** button, a new worksheet (Contact Membership) is added to the workbook. It shows the selected contact's Name, Description, the owning object type in the Parent Type column, along with the Parent Name and Parent Description. Even if a contact is a member of more than one KPI Data object.

You can overwrite any piece of the contact's definition data (with the exception of the Contact ID) directly in the cells, and also copy an existing Contact row and paste it into a new row (remove the Contact ID). Additionally, you can delete any contact by placing an **x** in the first column for each contact you want to delete, then click the Delete Selected Contacts button. All Contacts marked with an **x** will be deleted from the Visual KPI Server.

:::info Saving Data

In order to save your changes, place an **x** in the first column for each object you want to save. All Contacts marked with and **x** will be saved to the Visual KPI Server by clicking the **Save** button.

### Alerts

When working with KPIs, you can select the name of an alert template in a pull-down, appling all of the alert attributes assigned to that template. You can create as many Alert Templates as you want. Open the Alert Templates worksheet by clicking the Sitewide Settings configuration icon (add icon) and select **Contacts & Alerts** and then **Alert Templates**.

Click the **Membership of Selected Alert Templates** icon (add icon) to show each KPI that has an alert assigned, along with the name of the Alert Template assigned to it.
