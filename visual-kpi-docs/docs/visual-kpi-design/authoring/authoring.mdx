The Site Settings in the Visual KPI Designer allow you to change settings that affect your entire Visual KPI site. Any settings you change here are enabled sitewide.

The Site Settings icon (add icon) opens another toolset that allows you to configure all sorts things in your Visual KPI sites. Any changes you save will show up immediately in the Visual KPI site to which you are connected while editing these configurations. Users on the site will see changes you make when data refreshes.

Sitewide settings are grouped. Hover over each to see all of the site settings available.
