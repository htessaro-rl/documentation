In this section, you will learn the essential ideas to become a pro at using Visual KPI. These concepts lay the groundwork for a better understanding of the software, making it easier to get started.

Transpara system is an easy-to-use software that unifies all kinds of data into Visual KPIs that help organizations worldwide make assertive decisions based on real-time information. Its friendly user interface (UI) was designed to be easy to understand, customizable, and efficient in data analysis to enhance decision-making and improve the user adoption of the tool.

## Main concepts

- **Browser**: End-users do not need to install software since the system is accessed through a web browser. You can use it with any operational system on your laptop, mobile phone, or big screens across your plant. Anything that can run a web browser can be used to leverage Visual KPIs.  
You can create as many profiles as needed, selecting and editing the groups, dashboards, visualizations, and alerts for each one. This flexibility allows the user to build its ideal Visual KPI improve their own experience.

- **Responsive**: Transpara system prioritizes user experience by adapting its interface and functionality to suit different devices, ensuring accessibility and usability regardless of the platform. You can run it on any screen size. You don't need to worry about screen configurations to present your KPIs.

- **Real-Time**: You do not have to refresh the page to update the data. Our system runs in real-time, keeping you updated all the time. The user can configure the cash cycle for the data update and change it for trend analysis, receiving an immediate result for his search.

- **KPI**: KPIs are used to keep track of any information that serves as a metric that indicates the performance of critical activities within a company. They are essential for decision-makers, providing insights into performance trends and guiding strategic adjustments. Even though the data is gathered from multiple sources, the quick data processing and intuitive visualization enable users from different roles to visualize and monitor the key aspects of their work and make assertive decisions.

- **Status, color and alerting**: 
The importance of status, color, and alerting in Visual KPIs lies in their ability to condense complex data into easily understandable visual representations. Therefore, users can focus on critical areas requiring action or further analysis and make immediate decisions. 
Colors in Visual KPIs help distinguish between statuses such as good, satisfactory, and critical performance levels. Additionally, alerts enable users to take proactive measures when a KPI exceeds or falls below expected levels. Using these configurations, you can quickly grasp whether a particular metric meets expectations, falls short, or indicates an issue.
