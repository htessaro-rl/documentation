Visual KPI provides several ways to you access information. In this section you find information on how to use these features. Use this page to learn the basics and explores the pages you need.


## Basic navigation features 

Discover the key features that empower your navigation in Visual KPI, allowing you to seamlessly access and manage information.

### [Profiles](./profiles)


A profile consists of custom dashboards, bookmark bar, and watch list of important KPIs. You can create as many profiles as you need, customize them as you want, and switch between them anytime. Depending on how your team configure Visual KPI, you may have Private and Public profiles available. 

### [Dashboards](./dashboards)

Visual KPI Dashboards belong to profiles, and you can monitor all your operational information from them. You can have as many dashboards as you need. You can personalize them and add new visualizations to fit your purposes. The dashboard can be your personalized or role-based visualization of KPIs, charts, groups, and tables. 

### [Hierarchy/Groups](./groups)

Hierarchy or Groups define how you organize the information from your process within Visual KPI. It works as folders on your computer, so you can have as many groups as you need, with unlimited levels. Moreover, groups can contain several objects at any level of the hierarchy, including KPIs, charts, tables, or even other groups. Organizing your KPIs and other objects into groups helps you understand your problems and reflect your process organization. 

### [Visualizations](./visualization)

Visual KPI provides several visualization option you can use. Here is a list of the main automatic visualization options available in Visual KPI: 

1. **Group roll up**: In the **Groups** tab, you see the first group as All Groups, which summarizes all the KPIs from all groups in your Visual KPI. Click in one of the parent groups below to show the ones composing this parent. You can click in one of these child groups to see the KPIs that compose them. 

2. **Top bar**: In the top bar, you find different visualization options for your groups and KPIs, such as Filters, Only Show Descendant/Child Groups, Add Groups to Dashboard, View as List, KPI Map, Group Map, Group Table Map, and Geo Map. Each option is explained in detail in the End User Visualization Article. You can also create Ad Hoc groups with your search results and add them to your dashboard.

### [Search](./search)

Visual KPI embeds a large volume of information, and during its use, you may need to find specific information for any reason. You can use the Search Bar to get live results from all dashboards, groups, KPIs, charts, and tables that meet your search input. This feature shows you the top five search results within each object type, and you can click an object type to see all results that include the parameter you entered. The search results also present the KPI status to provide a quick status understanding. 

### [Analytics](./analytics)

Analytics, or Ad Hoc Trends, are a custom type of trend you can build in your Visual KPI, add to your dashboard, and monitor in real-time. For instance, if you are having trouble with multiple KPIs, you can trend them against each other to analyze if there is any correlation between them. You can create an Ad Hoc Trend from any KPI List View, using up to 20 KPIs (also called "pens"), and change the period for your analysis. 

### [Alerts](./alerts)

Visual KPI sends alert notifications or reminders to contact emails when any KPIs need attention. You can prevent false alerts when you have a piece of equipment that's OFF by setting its status as **Not in Service**. Moreover, every notification includes a link back to Visual KPI that takes you to a KPI live trend of the exact moment the alert occurred. 

### [Dark/Light Themes](./dark-light-theme)

Transpara team knows that some folks prefer to work in the dark. Those folks change the Visual KPI background interface. You can configure light & dark themes, set defaults, and decide whether users can change defaults. Furthermore, you can customize how the status of your KPIs appears in light and dark themes, selecting colors for each theme and each status. 

### [Time](./time)

Visual KPI shows your data in near real-time. The timestamp in the top bar of Visual KPI sites displays when data was last updated. You can choose to display the timestamp based on the server or client time, even if the server and Visual KPI client are in different time zones.

In addition to the Time reference, you can work with time ranges in Visual KPI. You can define a standard time range, customize a different time range for each object, or even display the same object using different time ranges.

Even though the information may come from several data sources, you control the Dashboard as one object.
