In this section you will learn how to choose between dark and light themes in your Visual KPI site.

By default, Visual KPI sites have a white background; this is the light theme. But you can add a dark theme to cut down on screen glare for use in environments where a black background would just make more sense. Your admin can fully customize how the status of your KPIs appear in light and dark themes, selecting colors for each theme and each status.
