Dashboards offer a personalized overview of your core information. Customize multiple dashboards to monitor the processes you manage efficiently. You can customize your dashboards with several Visual KPI objects like KPIs, charts, tables, groups, trends, and external links. In addition, it's possible to easily arrange, resize, and incorporate custom images, statistics, and dynamic text blocks.

## Selecting a dashboard

To change between different dashboards, use the **Dashboard** (<SvgFont data={selection.icons[10]} position={positions["100"]} />) pull-down menu to see the existing dashboards associated with the profile you are currently using. You also have the option to create new ones using the **New Dashboard** option from the menu.

  alt="Dropdown menu"
/>

You can have as many dashboards as you want, belonging to one or more profiles. When you change your profile, the dashboard list updates, presenting the dashboards linked with the current Dashboard.

## How to create a dashboard 

You can create a new dashboard from scratch or copy an existing one. For instance, copying an existing dashboard can be helpful when you want to edit a locked dashboard or compile dashboards from different profiles in your profile. To create a new dashboard, follow the steps below:

1. Click in the **Dashboard** icon (<SvgFont data={selection.icons[10]} position={positions["100"]} />).
2. Select **New Dashboard**.
3. Type a dashboard name and description.
4. If you want to copy an existing dashboard, check the **Copy Existing Dashboard** option.
    1. Use the pull-down menu to choose the existing dashboard you want to copy.
5. Click **Save**.

You'll be automatically redirected to the new dashboard page.

## Options menu

In the dashboard, the Options menu (<SvgFont data={selection.icons[188]} position={positions["100"]} />) offers different ways to interact with Visual KPI depending on what you are viewing, the configuration of your Dashboard, and whether it's locked or unlocked by the administrator. Here are the options available to you when on the Dashboard Tab:

1. **Customize Dashboard** (<SvgFont data={selection.icons[260]} position={positions["100"]} />): Allows you to customize your dashboard or create a new one, assuming you aren't using a locked profile. 

2. **New Dashboard** (<SvgFont data={selection.icons[10]} position={positions["100"]} />): It's an alternative way to create a new dashboard.

3. **Ad-Hoc Trend** (<SvgFont data={selection.icons[165]} position={positions["100"]} />): Create an Ad-Hoc Trend, a custom type of trend that you can build inside your Visual KPI site and add to your Dashboard.

4. **Pin to Bookmark Bar** (<SvgFont data={selection.icons[120]} position={positions["100"]} />): You can pin almost anything in Visual KPI to the bookmark bar, such as a KPI, chart, table, or external links. When you choose this option, Visual KPI creates a shortcut to the page you're accessing at that moment. Use the pins at the top to navigate to important pages quickly.

5. **Hide Bookmark Bar** (<SvgFont data={selection.icons[109]} position={positions["100"]} />): Use this option to hide the Bookmark Bar. 

6. **Show Dark/Light Theme** (<SvgFont data={selection.icons[68]} position={positions["100"]} /> or <SvgFont data={selection.icons[80]} position={positions["100"]} />): Switch between Dark and Light Themes.

7. **View in Server/Client Time** (<SvgFont data={selection.icons[52]} position={positions["100"]} />): Change between Server and Client Time, regardless of time zones.

If you are in the Groups, KPIs, Charts, or Tables tabs, you'll see the **Add to Dashboard** option by accessing the **Options** menu. Click in the **Add to Dashboard** option to add the selected object to the current Dashboard. 

## Customize a dashboard

In addition to creating Dashboards based on existing models, you can arrange your Dashboard to suit your needs by:

- Resizing and moving KPIs.
- Selecting different KPIs' visualization.
- Adding new objects.
- Defining custom time ranges.

:::note Save your changes

After customizing the dashboard, don't forget to click **Save** at the bottom of the Customize Dashboard panel or click on the green checkmark (<SvgFont data={selection.icons[190]} position={positions["100"]} />) at the top once you have customized your Dashboard.

:::

### Resize and move objects

The option to resize and move KPIs and other objects enables you to place the KPIs you use often or need to see immediately at the top and make KPIs larger or smaller in size. 

To resize or move KPIs in your dashboard, follow the steps describe below:

1. Click in the **Options** menu (<SvgFont data={selection.icons[188]} position={positions["100"]} />).
2. Select **Customize Dashboard** (<SvgFont data={selection.icons[260]} position={positions["100"]} />).
3. On the **Customize Your Dashboard** board, you find blocks representing the existing KPIs and other objects from the current Dashboard.
    - **Move**: To move an object, drag and drop it into place. As you move the object around the dashboard, others will move over to make room.
    - **Resize**: To resize an object, you have some options:
        - Drag the lower-right corner to resize an object.
        - Drag right or left to make the object wider or narrower.
        - Drag up or down to change the object height.
4. After setting all objects, click **Save** at the bottom of the screen or click on the green checkmark at the top (<SvgFont data={selection.icons[190]} position={positions["100"]} />).

You can see a configuration example in the GIF below.

:::info KPIs and other Objects sizes

KPIs and other objects vary in size based on their type. 

- Geo Maps and KPI lists must be at least 50 percent the width of your Dashboard (up to 100 percent width). 
- Charts, trends, texts, or image widgets can be as small as 25 percent of the Dashboard width. 
- KPI dashboard widgets can range from 25 to 50 percent width. The same applies to height. 
- Some Dashboard objects can expand to 8 times (8x) the original height.

### Select an object visualization 

Some Visual KPI objects have multiple possible visualizations and information that can be displayed directly on the Dashboard. You can select the visualization and information you want to see on your Dashboard through the dashboard customization page. To change the visualization option, follow the steps below:

1. Click in the **Options** menu (<SvgFont data={selection.icons[188]} position={positions["100"]} />).
2. Select **Customize Dashboard** (<SvgFont data={selection.icons[260]} position={positions["100"]} />).
3. Select the object block you want to change the visualization in the **Customize Your Dashboard** board. A green dashed border appears around the selected object and a new board will show up listing all available visualization options. 
4. Check the visualization option you want to see in the dashboard for the selected object. Depending on the object type, different option will be available. The complete list is presented below:
    - Sparkline
    - Bullet Chart
    - Status History Chart
    - Statistics 
    - Actions
5. Click **Apply**.

:::info Not Saved Changes 

If you change a visualization or information selection and don't click **Apply**, a red border will appear around the object to show that you haven't saved your changes.

### Add new objects to your Dashboard 

You can add any object to your dashboard. To add a new visualization:

1. Access the KPI, object, or any visualization you want to add to the dashboard.
2. Click in the **Options** menu (<SvgFont data={selection.icons[188]} position={positions["100"]} />).
3. Select one of the three option available:
    - **Add to *Dashboard*** (<SvgFont data={selection.icons[115]} position={positions["100"]} />): The current dashboard name will be in the *Dashboard* place. This option add the current view directly to the dashboard you're currently using.
    - **Add to New Dashboard** (<SvgFont data={selection.icons[115]} position={positions["100"]} />): This enables you to use the current visualization in a new dashboard that you will create.
    **Add to Existing Dashboard** (<SvgFont data={selection.icons[115]} position={positions["100"]} />): Use this option to add the current visualization to another dashboard other than the one you are currently using. 

The current object will be available in the selected dashboard. You can use the [resize and move objects](dashboards#resize-and-move-objects) position it in the desired place.

### Customize the Time Range 

When you first access a dashboard, each KPI typically uses a different Time Range to present data. However, to perform some analysis, it's important to have all objects using the same Time Range to examine cause and effect, for example.

To define a standard Time Range for all objects in your dashboard, follow the steps below:

1. Click in the Time Range Picker (<SvgFont data={selection.icons[244]} position={positions["100"]} />).
2. Select a default or custom Time Range.

All data related to time will be displayed on your Dashboard based on the selected range. Use the time range paddles to advance or regress the time range. For example, if you selected a 24-hour time range, the advance paddle will show KPI data for the following 24-hour period.

:::info Some objects aren't based on Time Ranges 

Some objects, such as Geo Maps, don't have an associated Time Range. They only present the current value. Therefore, no changes occur in those objects when you change the Time Range.
