The Visual KPI search feature allows you to search any object within your Visual KPI site, including dashboards, KPIs, groups, charts, and tables, following these parameters: 

- Dashboards: name and description. 
- Groups: name and description. 
- KPIs: name, description, and actual lookups (tags, equations, etc.). 
- Charts: name and description. 
- Tables: name and description. 
- Trends: pen names and pen lookups. 

The search feature is live, meaning live results will be displayed below the search bar as you type. The Visual KPI search feature shows you the top 5 search results within each object type and the live status of each. If a KPI has a status, the status will appear in the search results. If you need to do a quick search on the status of a KPI, you can enter the name of the KPI in search and see the status in the results.  

## Create Ad Hoc Groups

Click an object type to see all results that include the parameter you entered. Using the Visual KPI search feature, you can even create ad-hoc groups of all KPIs that include your search parameter. When you search, all results are returned and categorized by object type. When you click the top-level object, you see all KPIs that match your search parameter, and youâ€™ve effectively created a group. This ad hoc group has all the tools and options available in any group.
