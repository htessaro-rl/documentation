Visual KPI can tell users when they should pay attention and where they should be looking in the software through alert notifications, which can be sent to your email, for example. On this page, you will learn about notifications and the types of alerts you can configure.  

Every notification includes a link to Visual KPI (the big, green button). Specifically, this link takes you to a live KPI trend marked with the exact moment the alert took place. This lets you also see what happened leading up to the event and whatâ€™s happened since (regardless of when you click the link). Additionally, you can comment on a specific point or a period of the KPI trend to understand the issue notified by the alert.

Visual KPI Alerts are based on the status of the KPI and are configurable in many ways:

- Alert templates: define reusable alert scenarios, including when to send notifications and/or reminders (unique to each status), time-in-state, escalations (notifying different sets of users for each status), how much detail to include in the notification, etc. 
- Contacts: Three levels of contacts for each KPI (contacts can be individual users, groups of users, or a mixture of both). 
- Notification Type: Visual KPI currently supports email notifications, but SMS will also be available soon. (Contact us if you are interested.)
