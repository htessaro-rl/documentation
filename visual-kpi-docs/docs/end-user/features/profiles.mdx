Profiles are where your Dashboards live and all the personalized layer of visual KPI is for an end user. A profile is a collection of important things that are personalized for a user, but it doesn't need to be a person, it could be a role, a site, a room, an asset, or anything else you might want. 

A profile can be grouped into profile groups, like only for executives, maintenance, a plant, or anything else. Additionally, the administrator can lock down entire profiles or individually lock down dashboards. Therefore, in a locked profile or dashboard, if you try to use the gear you're going to see that there are limited options, such as Customize Dashboard. The profile contains three different things: 

1. **Dashboards**: You can create and personalize as many dashboards as you want for each profile, so you can easily toggle back and forth between them. You can also copy dashboards from other profiles and lock them to block editing of any format from other users.
2. **Bookmark bar**: If you change profiles then you're going to change to a different bookmark bar but if you only change dashboards you'll stay within the same profile, so your bookmark bar stays the same. 
3. **Watchlist**: The watchlist gives you a set of customizable favorites list of KPIs. You can add as many to it as you want and the orange number beside the timestamp tells you how many KPIs on your watchlist are in an alert condition. By default, you see them sorted by 'in alert' and 'not alert'. You can you multiple [KPI Visualizations](./visualization/kpi) with the top bar icons and sort the list by using the arroes beside the collum title.

## Bookmark bar

The list below presents some of the items you can pin to the Visual KPI bookmark bar:

- A dashboard in your profile
- A dashboard from another profile to which you have access
- A table
- A chart
- A KPI trend
- An ad hoc trend
- Embedded content you've added to Visual KPI charts

You can also pin an element to the bookmark bar using the Options icon (<SvgFont data={selection.icons[188]} position={positions["100"]} />). Navigate to the dashboard, object, or other element you want to pin to the bookmark bar and use the Options icon (<SvgFont data={selection.icons[188]} position={positions["100"]} />) to access the pull-down menu to select Pin to Bookmark Bar.
