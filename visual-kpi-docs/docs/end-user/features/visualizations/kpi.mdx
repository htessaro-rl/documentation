KPIs are used to keep track of any information that serves as a metric that indicates the performance of critical activities within a company. They're essential for decision-makers, providing insights into performance trends and guiding strategic adjustments. When you click in the KPI tab, you see the following options on the top bar:

1. **[Filter](/docs/end-user/basic-navigation/visualization)** (<SvgFont icon="184"/>): Filter by status or distance from where you are standing. 
2. **Grouping** (<SvgFont icon="114"/>): Allows you to group your KPIs by Standard or Custom Attributes such as Status, Group, or any other that makes sense for your organization. Your admin can configure Custom Attributes.
3. **[Only Show Descendant/Child Groups](/docs/end-user/basic-navigation/visualization)** (<SvgFont icon="208"/>/<SvgFont icon="207"/>): Show all child items of the group you are currently viewing or collapse the list to go to the top level of the current list. 
4. **Time Ranges** (<SvgFont icon="244"/>): Configure a Time Range for all your KPIs. Especially useful when using Trend View to compare values.
5. **Revert** (<SvgFont icon="222"/>): Return to the default KPI view.
6. **Select KPIs** (<SvgFont icon="255"/>): Select multiple KPIs by clicking the box to the left of any KPI in the list.
7. **[View as List](/docs/end-user/basic-navigation/visualization)** (<SvgFont icon="206"/>): This is the default view in the Group view, but you can see your data in other visualizations. 
8. **View as Bullet Chart** (<SvgFont icon="171"/>): It's similar to the KPI List View and Status History view, but the KPI Bullet Chart view focuses on the current status of the KPI relative to targets and limits.
9. **View as Trend List** (<SvgFont icon="192"/>): Present the KPIs as trends, so you can quickly compare the KPIs values from your Group.
10. **View as Status History Chart** (<SvgFont icon="37"/>): Projects vertical color bars to show Highs and Lows or other targets based on status color.
11. **View as Status History Map**: Similar to Status History Chart, but you can see a status history chart in the trend view. Click the Status Background icon to activate the background.
12. **[View as KPI Map](/docs/end-user/basic-navigation/visualization)** (<SvgFont icon="203"/>): KPI maps, if configured by your admin, show a graphical heat map of all the KPIs in the level you are currently viewing.
13. **[View as Group Map](/docs/end-user/basic-navigation/visualization)** (<SvgFont icon="141"/>): Shows a bar across the top of each group to indicate the status of the group as determined by the Group Map settings.
14. **[View as Group Map Table](/docs/end-user/basic-navigation/visualization)** (<SvgFont icon="21"/>): Similar to the Group Map View, it shows the groups as titles in a table.  
15. **[View as Geo Table](/docs/end-user/basic-navigation/visualization)** (<SvgFont icon="189"/>): The Group Map view is similar to the KPI Map but gives each group its status.  
16. **View Status Summary** (<SvgFont icon="136"/>): Shows you a summary and history of your best and worst KPIs at the group level in Pareto chart form.
17. **View Status History** (<SvgFont icon="138"/>): Shows you the relative performance of the selected KPIs grouped into the various status options.
18. **View Notification History** (<SvgFont icon="137"/>): See how many times notifications have been sent for the KPIs in alert status.

Actual is the current, real-time value of the KPI, and Target is where you want it to be.

## Grouping

Click the Grouping icon (<SvgFont icon="114"/>) to group your KPIs by Standard or Custom Attributes such as Status, Group, or any other that makes sense for your organization since your admin can configure Custom Attributes. You can also select the Bullet Chart Type (default, actual EU, deviation EU or deviation %) for the Bullet Chart view (<SvgFont icon="171"/>).

## View as bullet chart

The KPI Bullet Chart view (<SvgFont icon="171"/>) is similar to the KPI List View (<SvgFont icon="206"/>) and Status History view (<SvgFont icon="138"/>), but the KPI Bullet Chart view focuses on the current status of the KPI relative to targets and limits. The KPI Bullet Chart view is optimized for mobile, so comparing peer KPIs at a glance is easy.

For the KPI Bullet Chart, you have multiple view options. Use the Grouping icon to select from the Default view, Actual EU (engineering units), Deviation %, and Deviation EU. 

For this view, each KPI requires a minimum amount of information to be included in its configuration. For example, you need a minimum of one limit and even then it will be very limited. One of the most important attributes to add to each KPI is a min and max value. These are the limits of what you expect to be possible and where any value outside of this is most likely incorrect data (for example, a KPI measuring available disk space should never be able to show a negative number or a number larger than the size of your disk).

In all cases, the leftmost edge is defined by the first non-empty low side value (min, LLL, LL, L, Actual) while the rightmost edge is defined by the last non-empty high side value (max, HHH, HH, H, Actual). 

The example below shows the Deviation % view which centers the target and shows which KPIs are deviating by a great % from their target.

Below is an example Bullet Chart list starting with its associated limit information from the Visual KPI Designer and followed by the resulting view in the Visual KPI client view.

## View as trend list

The Trend view (<SvgFont icon="192"/>) shows a real-time trend of KPIs, which are great for visualizing historical and time-stamped data by just moving your mouse over the trends. Trends can be configured in Visual KPI Designer or created on the fly by users in your Visual KPI sites.

You can visualize trends for individual KPIs or select up to 20 individual KPIs to view and compare as trends. With trends, you can compare multiple values, or the same value, at different times. And as with all KPIs, you can see the trend change in real-time as the data changes.

Trends are highly configurable. You can go back as far as data exists, define and customize time ranges, and more. You can even define custom, Ad Hoc trends right from your device and add them to your Dashboard. Use filters, grouping, and time ranges to elaborate all kinds of trends. Learn more about [Trends](/docs/end-user/features/visualizations/trends) and their different types of visualization.

## View as status history chart

The KPI Status History view (<SvgFont icon="37"/>) shows you a summary and history of your best and worst KPIs at the group level. This view is similar to the KPI List view and the KPI Bullet Chart view, but the KPI Status History view shows status changes over time. Clicking on a KPI in this view opens the full KPI Status History Trend.

## View status summary

Visual KPI shows you a summary and history of your best and worst KPIs at the group level. Status Summary (<SvgFont icon="136"/>), Status History (<SvgFont icon="138"/>), and Notification History (<SvgFont icon="137"/>) allow you to track over time the history of KPIs in alert and when alert notifications have been sent. You can see Status for the entire group as a Pareto chart, and then get more details for individual KPIs. Also, adjust the time range to see a summary or history over a given reference, and freely scroll back and forward in time.

For any group of KPIs, retrieve a list of KPIs that displays relative performance over the period defined. The Pareto chart shows which KPIs are the worst performing as a percentage of the total. Move your mouse over a KPI in the chart to see a value.

## View status history

The KPI Status History view (<SvgFont icon="138"/>) shows you a summary and history of your best and worst KPIs at the group level. This view is similar to the KPI List view and the KPI Bullet Chart view, but the KPI Status History view shows status changes over time by projecting pre-configured background colors on your trends. Clicking on a **KPI** in this view opens the full KPI Status History Trend.

{/* This view shows you the relative performance of the selected KPIs grouped into the various status options. For example, discover what percentage of KPIs were in a “high” state during this period. Move your mouse over each bar in the chart to see the status name and a value. */}

For Status Summary (<SvgFont icon="136"/>) and Status History (<SvgFont icon="138"/>) views, you can switch between alert count and time-in-state.

First, select the Status Summary icon, or the Status History icon, then use:

1. **Alert Count or Status Count icons** (<SvgFont icon="151"/>):
- for Status Summary, to see how many times the KPIs have been in an alert state over the defined period, or have reached a particular status over time.
- for Status History, to see how many times a KPI has reached a particular status over time.

2. **Time-in-State icon** (<SvgFont icon="287"/>):
- for Status Summary, to see how much time a KPI spent in an alert state.
- for Status History, in a status state.

Click any KPI in the Pareto chart to see a trend over time and a list view below the trend.

/>

## View notification history

For any group, see how many times notifications have been sent for the KPIs in alert status by clicking the Notification History icon (<SvgFont icon="137"/>). Note the log for status change below the Pareto chart, which also shows the performance of each KPI relative to the others in the group as a % of the total.

## KPI details view

When accessing KPIs, you may want to know more about a particular one. Clicking the **View Details** icon (<SvgFont icon="267"/>) you may find any of the following KPI details:

1. Contacts
2. Links
3. KPI properties
4. KPI stats
5. Parameters
6. Manual data entry (if enabled)
7. Custom attributes
8. Membership 

{/* <StylizedImage

  alt="KPI Details"
/> */}

## KPI link view

You'll find links all over Visual KPI. Visual KPI links can be configured by administrators or by Visual KPI site users. The link view isn't limited to internal links, you can add external links to software or other tools you use often. Some of the most common places you'll find the Visual KPI links view are:

1. **Visual KPI objects**: Links from an object, such as a KPI, chart, or group. These are added as an attribute via Visual KPI Designer and they're tied to the object and available to all profiles.
2. **Dashboard link widgets**: using the [Customize Dashboard widget](/docs/end-user/features/dashboards) you can tie a link to a Dashboard. However, only profiles with access to these Dashboards will see them.
3. **Bookmark bar links**: Links on the [Bookmark bar](/docs/end-user/features/profiles) are tied to a profile. 
4. **Nav bar links**: These links, configured by your admin, are sitewide and everyone with access to the site will see them. 
5. **KPI detail pages**: Links for the KPI detail view must be configured by your admin.
