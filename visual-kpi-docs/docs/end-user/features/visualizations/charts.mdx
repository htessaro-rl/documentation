Charts show data as it relates to its defined limits. Visual KPI uses many chart types to visualize data using status, colors, and limits. The chart view options are:

1. [Bar charts](/docs/end-user/features/visualizations/charts#bar-charts)
2. [Pareto charts](/docs/end-user/features/visualizations/charts#pareto-charts)
3. [Pie charts](/docs/end-user/features/visualizations/charts#pie-chats)
4. [Box plots](/docs/end-user/features/visualizations/charts#box-plots)
5. [Gantt charts](/docs/end-user/features/visualizations/charts#gantt-charts)
6. [Gauge charts](/docs/end-user/features/visualizations/charts#gauge-charts)
7. [XY plots](/docs/end-user/features/visualizations/charts#xy-plots)

### Bar charts

Bar charts (<SvgFont icon="142"/>) can be used to show comparisons of data against targets and limits in either a vertical or horizontal chart. You can compare only one specific set of data, where each bar represents the data, or you can cluster data sets so that each specific set has its bar. Still, the related sets are clustered and compared against other clustered data.

Depending on the configuration by your admin, Bar Charts can be:

- Time-series or non-time-series data.
- Manually or query-based configured.
- Stacked and clustered.
- Horizontal or vertical.
- Custom colored.
- Color changing above and below the target.

### Pareto charts

Pareto Charts (<SvgFont icon="132"/>) can help you quickly see which of your assets are most critical and know where you need to focus. A Pareto chart contains both bars and a line graph, where individual values are represented in descending order by bars, and the line represents the cumulative total.

Pareto Charts show assets and values in the bars and use a line to show cumulative effect. They can be used to monitor quality control, showing where most problems come from.

You can even show relative data using stacked Pareto charts. Each bar can show multiple values, each displaying a different color, and as you move your cursor over each bar, you'll see the actual values as tooltips.

### Pie chats

Pie Charts (<SvgFont icon="124"/>) display a simple graphic that shows the relative proportions of your compared assets. However, Pie Charts have some disadvantages for Visual KPI, such as their size for screen presentation and the limited ability to compare peer data. 

Depending on how they're configured by your admin, Pie Charts can be:

- Manually and query-based configured.
- Mouse over dynamic.

### Box plots

Box Plots display variation in samples without making assumptions about the underlying statistical distribution. In Visual KPI, Box Plots can be based on time-series data, or non-time-series data. 

Box Plots display a dataset through quartiles:

- **Minimum**: the lowest data point, excluding any outliers.
- **Median**: the middle value of the dataset.
- **Maximum**: the largest data point, excluding any outliers.
- **First quartile (q1)**: the median of the lower half of the dataset.
- **Third quartile (q3)**: the median of the upper half of the dataset.

Box Plots can be created by end users in Visual KPI sites, or admins can create Box Plots in Visual KPI Designer. Box Plots can be created manually or they can be query-based.

### Gantt chart

Gantt Charts (<SvgFont icon="122"/>) are great for showing time-sequenced events. They can show you all of the elements of a project along a timeline, including when each element is scheduled to be completed, any dependencies, and the status of each. Task or project elements are listed along the vertical axis of the Gantt Chart and the horizontal axis displays time intervals.

:::note Gantt Charts

Gantt Charts are only query-based in Visual KPI, and they must be created by your admin.

### Gauge charts

Gauge charts (<SvgFont icon="11"/>), also known as Dial or Speedometer, are a meter-type visualization that shows the real-time status of a KPI, indicated by a gauge and needle, within a range that includes targets and actual values. These charts include minimum and maximum ranges, along with an indicator for an ideal target. They also can be used to show actual performance versus targets or progress toward a target for anything from temperature, weight, and speed to percentages of sales or work completed, performance, and more.

Gauge charts are ideal for showing:

- Actual status related to targets.
- Progress toward a goal.
- Percentage measurement.

If configured by your admin, you can visualize any trend as a Gauge chart. Simply click the gauge icon on any KPI trend view.

### XY plots

XY plots (<SvgFont icon="133"/>), or Scatter Charts as they're sometimes called, show the relationships between two data sets. They're great for showing correlations between one or many variables or calculations. 

Based on how your admin configures XY Plots or Scatter Charts, they may be:

- Time-series or non-time-series.
- Manually or query-based configured.
