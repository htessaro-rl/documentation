The basic navigation [Groups](./basic-navigation/groups) page addressed how Groups work just like folders on your PC, and you can have as many groups as you want, unlimited levels of groups containing multiple objects at any level of the hierarchy. Moreover, on that page, are listed functions such as Drilling Down Through Groups, Breadcrumbs, and some visualization views.

Now we will go deeper into the different types of objects that you can find in Groups. We will also explore more visualization options for your Groups to help you understand your data, leading to better decisions.

## KPIs

The KPI tab on the Visual KPI main menu shows all KPIs at the level you are currently viewing. The default view for the KPI tab is the List View, which shows the KPI name, status, sparkline, actual and target values, a bullet chart, and details. KPIs in this view can be filtered and grouped by status or attribute. All group views have analytics built right in. 

Learn more about the other view options on our [KPI Visualization](./visualization/kpi) page.

## Charts

Charts show data as it relates to its defined limits. Visual KPI uses color to show status, and the chart includes marks for the target value, high and low limits, and so on. Visual KPI uses many chart types to visualize data in ways that make sense to you. A trend is just another chart with defined limits.

The Charts tab on the Visual KPI navigation bar displays any charts that are available at the group level you are currently viewing. For example, if you drill down into a sub-group, you'll see only charts for that sub-group, if any charts exist in that sub-group.

:::note Viewing Charts

Not all Groups have charts. If there are no charts in the group (or its child groups) you are viewing, the Charts tab will disappear. If the Charts tab is grayed out, there are charts in child groups and you can click to see them.

### Charts view

The Chart List View shows you the chart name, the type of chart, a mini visualization of the chart, and a description of the chart. You can use the Filters (<SvgFont data={selection.icons[184]} position={positions["100"]} />) and the Headers (<SvgFont data={selection.icons[252]} position={positions["100"]} />) to filter and sort your data. Learn more about [Filters](./basic-navigation/visualization).

The quickest way to see all charts available on your Visual KPI website is to click the Home icon (<SvgFont data={selection.icons[266]} position={positions["100"]} />). This will take you to the top-level group. If there are any charts at the Home level, you can click the **Charts** tab to see them. To drill down further and see charts for all descendant groups, click **Show Charts for this Group and All Child Groups** (<SvgFont data={selection.icons[208]} position={positions["100"]} />).

At the Charts tab, you can use a menu that allows you to interact with the chart or change the parameters. Use your mouse to scroll over the chart and see values or other information associated with the chart.

:::note Menu Changes

The menu will change depending on the type of chart you are viewing.

## Tables

Any table that lives in an SQL-based data source (SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, Excel, Access, and more) can be converted in a Visual KPI's Tables feature. Your admin must set up tables in Visual KPI Designer. 

Similarly to Charts, the Tables tab on Visual KPI's main navigation menu displays any tables available in the group you are currently viewing and it will not appear if there are no tables in the group or its child groups.

### Tables view

You can configure multiple tables from the same data and add color and icons to your tables to highlight status based on the parameters you set. So, you can be free to create maintenance logs, shift reports, and error lists, or use any other tabular data you have access to. Click **Tables** in the navigation bar and expand this list to see tables for all child groups available to you. To open any table in the list, click on its name in the list.

If you are in the Tables list view (<SvgFont data={selection.icons[206]} position={positions["100"]} />), click the **More** icon (<SvgFont data={selection.icons[128]} position={positions["100"]} />) in any table to open a drop-down panel that shows some basic information about the table. Whereas the View Full Table Details icon (<SvgFont data={selection.icons[127]} position={positions["100"]} />) opens the System Configuration Details screen. This gives you detailed information about the configuration of the table set up by your admin in the Visual KPI Designer.

Visual KPI Tables features:

1. Visualize any tabular or rectangular data.
2. Visualize time-series or non-time-series data.
3. Tables support time ranges/filtering and can be scrolled forward or back in time.
4. Tables can be query-based.
5. Tables can be searched, and so can individual columns.
6. Tables support HTML content.

### Tables data

You can use the (1) Export to CSV icon (<SvgFont data={selection.icons[182]} position={positions["100"]} />) to export table data for further analysis or view the raw data from a table by clicking the (2) View Table Data icon (<SvgFont data={selection.icons[232]} position={positions["100"]} />). Raw table data can be sorted by using the (3) Headers (<SvgFont data={selection.icons[252]} position={positions["100"]} />) to sort by any column. Once you have sorted by a single column, you can sort by a second column by holding down the shift key and clicking on the second column you wish to sort.

The (4) Search Table icon (<SvgFont data={selection.icons[125]} position={positions["100"]} />) allows you to search dynamically for anything within the table. This is especially useful for tables with lots of data. You can also search Table columns by clicking at the top of any column to search based on the information in that column. Additionally, share tables using the (5) Share tab.
