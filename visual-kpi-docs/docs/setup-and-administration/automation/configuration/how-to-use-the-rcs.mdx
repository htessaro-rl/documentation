Visual KPI RCS can integrate with both AF databases, or any SQL data source. For each integration type there are specific configurations that need to be done. While AF configurations mostly happens on their side of the integration, SQL will require you to configure a few queries, as Visual KPI will need to know what attributes to look for.

## Installing Visual KPI RCS

To install a new RCS in your Visual KPI instance, you need to follow the steps below:

<LinkCards data={
  [
    {
      name: 'AF Databases',
      linkTo: '/docs/setup-and-administration/automation/rcs-with-af-databases'
    },
    {
      name: 'SQL Databases',
      linkTo: '/docs/setup-and-administration/automation/rcs-with-sql-databases'
    },
  ]
}/>
