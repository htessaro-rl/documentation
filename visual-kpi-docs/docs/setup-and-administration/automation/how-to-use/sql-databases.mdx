The Visual KPI Remote Context Server can connect to any SQL data source. All required is ODBC access with appropriate read-level permissions.

For effective mapping between foreign systems and Visual KPI, it's crucial to assign a unique and consistent identifier to each object in the system such as KPI, Group, Trend, etc. This identifier can be in the form of a string, GUID or an integer, and it should be specific to the object type. By doing so, Visual KPI can ensure that there is no confusion in the mapping process. 

:::note
If the ID changes in the foreign system, a new object will be created in Visual KPI and the old object will be deleted.
:::

Every definition query (KPI, Group, Chart) must include a column called **METAID** with a unique value.

## SQL RCS Best Practices

For all interfaced fields, Visual KPI supports the recommended _interface_ name or _interface ID_ if used with the correct field name.

### Example

If you have an interface named _ODBC-Localhost_ with an ID of _4e432114-499c-44e1-994d-7690de272b74_, you can use _Latitude_ as the lookup value and set _LatitudeInterface_ to _ODBC-Localhost_.

#### Or

You can use _Latitude_ and _LatitudeInterfaceID_ where _Latitude_ is the lookup value and _LatitudeInterfaceID_ is _4e432114-499c-44e1-994d-7690de272b74_.
