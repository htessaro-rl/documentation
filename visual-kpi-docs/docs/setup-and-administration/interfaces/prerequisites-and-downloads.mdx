Before connecting interfaces to Visual KPI, make sure you meet the following prerequisites:

- Install Visual KPI Server and Server Manager.  
- You need to have the data source client tools installed on the **Visual KPI Server**. For example, SQL Server Management Studio, proper Oracle drivers (and a client to test them, such as Toad), PI SDK for OSIsoft, etc.  
- You need to have the necessary rights and knowledge to access the database, test the connection, and query the desired data.  
- It is also important to have the client tools mentioned above for testing the interfaces.
