Historian interfaces are designed to display time-series data, which is represented by a series of successive values over a period of time. Such interfaces typically show a starting value, an ending value, and intermediate values that are based on equal time intervals. Examples of time-series data include weather temperatures, ocean tides, stock market values, and production line output.

Time-series data is a type of data that is commonly used in industrial processes and corporate business metrics. This type of data is used to analyze data to identify trends and patterns, which can help to form the basis for forecasts or identify occurrences of abnormal operating conditions. Time-series data is often used for quality control purposes as well.
