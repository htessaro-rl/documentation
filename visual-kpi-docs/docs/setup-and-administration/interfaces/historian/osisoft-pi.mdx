The Visual KPI PI interface is a web service that communicates with OSIsoft's PI-SDK to retrieve data from a PI Server. To use this interface, you need to install the PI interface on a machine that already has OSIsoft's PI-SDK installed. 

:::tip
See [Prerequisites and Software Downloads](/docs/setup-and-administration/prerequisites-downloads) for a link to the PI-SDK.
:::

To install and configure the PI interface, make use of the **Visual KPI Server Manager**. You can install the interface on the Visual KPI Server or any machine that is accessible to the Visual KPI Server via HTTP. In case you want to install the interface on a machine other than Visual KPI Server, you should first install the Visual KPI Server Manager.

## Configuring a PI Interface

If you need to change any configuration of your created PI interface, you can. Just select the interface you need to configure. You can modify any configuration settings that are not grayed out.

After making changes, remember to click _Apply_ to save changes. And ensure the connection is working correctly.
