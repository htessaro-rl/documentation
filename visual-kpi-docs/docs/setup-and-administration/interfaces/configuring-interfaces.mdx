## Prerequisites

Before connecting interfaces to Visual KPI, make sure you meet the following prerequisites:

- Install Visual KPI Server and Server Manager.  
- You need to have the data source client tools installed on the **Visual KPI Server**. For example, SQL Server Management Studio, proper Oracle drivers (and a client to test them, such as Toad), PI SDK for OSIsoft, etc.  
- You need to have the necessary rights and knowledge to access the database, test the connection, and query the desired data.  
- It's also important to have the client tools mentioned above for testing the interfaces.

## Steps for Installing Visual KPI Interfaces

Regardless of the data source, the process of setting up a Visual KPI interface involves these common procedures:

1. Make sure to install the native client tools of the data source on the **Visual KPI Server**. You can find links to the vendor drivers and other necessary software in [Prerequisites and Downloads](/docs/setup-and-administration/prerequisites-downloads).
2. Using **Visual KPI Server Manager**, install the interface.
3. Use the **Visual KPI Server Manager** to configure the connection.
4. Verify the connection.
5. Test the connection.
6. Use **[Visual KPI Designer](/docs/visual-kpi-design/overview)** to define an interface for a KPI.
