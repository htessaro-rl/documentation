SQL-based interfaces are designed to provide a standardized method to communicate with relational databases. Two prevalent technologies that we use in this domain are ODBC (Open Database Connectivity) and OLEDB (Object Linking and Embedding, Database). 

## ODBC Databases

Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) is an API used to access SQL database management systems that is widely used by relational databases.

## OLEDB Databases

Object Linking and Embedding, Database (OLEDB) is a Microsoft API that enables accessing data from various sources uniformly. OLEDB utilizes the Component Object Model and was initially developed to replace ODBC. However, it is no longer supported by Microsoft. Some data sources still use OLEDB, though it is now considered deprecated.

:::note
Visual KPI also allows a direct, or native, SQL Server interface, but it is only used in special circumstances. ODBC is preferred for 99% of all connections to SQL data sources. Please contact us at support@transpara.com if you need more information about SQL interfaces.
