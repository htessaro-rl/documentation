## Installing an Interface

To install a new interface, follow these steps:

1. In **Visual KPI Server Manager**, select the site you desire to install a new interface.
2. Right-click in the **Interfaces** tab, and select the **Install New Visual KPI Interface** option.
3. Select the interface you want to install from [all available interfaces](#interfaces) presented.
4. A install wizard will open.
5. Follow the installation process, adding the necessary information as requested.

After these steps, you will have your new interface ready. Most interfaces in Visual KPI are pre-packaged interfaces that include all components and are configured along the installation wizard without the need for queries.
