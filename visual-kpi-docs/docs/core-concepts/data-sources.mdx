The data presented on Visual KPI doesn't require a special storage system. The truth is that Visual KPI doesn't require you to move your data from the server or cloud system you are currently using. Visual KPI will consider all systems used by your company as data sources to retrieve information. Rather than migrating data into a new centralized repository, Visual KPI communicates with these diverse sources, eliminating the need for data duplication and making management more straightforward.

This capability enables Visual KPI to access real-time data, providing up-to-the-minute information with added context, color, status indicators, and meaningful insights. By interfacing with different data sources, Visual KPI ensures you're always working with the latest data without the hassle of manual updates or migration.

## Types of data sources

Visual KPI provides comprehensive support for various data source types, requiring specialized [interfaces](./interfaces) for each source. These data sources can be broadly categorized into several classes. A summary of the vast data sources seamlessly available for integration with Visual KPI is listed below: 

- **Industrial and enterprise historians**, like OSIsoft PI, GE Proficy, Rockwell, Honeywell, and more.
- **Relational databases**, such as Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, and Access.
- External web services, which may provide data like weather conditions, market pricing, and supplier information through an API.
- **Manual data entries** via Excel, form applications, or directly within Visual KPI.
- **Business applications** including ERP, CRM, and specialized industry software.
- **Data obtained from devices** like sensors, IoT, IIoT, and control systems (DCS/PLC).

Visual KPI delivers real-time updates, eliminating the need for manual page refreshes to access the most current data. It continuously interacts with data sources, ensuring a near real-time experience.

## Data sources requirements

Different data sources may require different processes to integrate completely with Visual KPI to recover data in real-time. This involves understanding whether data must be retrieved from external systems or databases. However, the Transpara team is always ready to assist you. Furthermore, if you use a different database from those listed above, do not worry; we can handle it to ensure it works seamlessly with Visual KPI.

## What is next?

Visual KPI allows users to integrate data from various sources seamlessly. Integrating data sources ensures that data is readily available and can be effectively utilized within the system.

As a next step, we encourage you to access the [Interfaces](./interfaces) page to learn how different databases are connected to Visual KPI.
