Data security is a top priority for Transpara and Visual KPI. Various security measures are in place to safeguard your KPI data throughout the entire process, from integrating data sources to presenting KPIs on the Visual KPI dashboard.

## Object-level security

Visual KPI implements object-level security for its sites, allowing you to tailor the security model and level of detail to your organization's needs. This involves creating user groups and assigning different access levels to each group. Since access permissions are defined at the object level, end-users won't notice any differences in the interface. Object-level security access groups are set up using the Visual KPI Designer.

The process for defining different access levels involves three simple steps:

1. Create local user groups.
2. Enable object-level security.
3. Assign diffefent access levels to KPIs and Objects for the previously created groups.

As a result, KPIs and groups not part of a user's access level won't appear on the screen. Consequently, user groups with different access levels can access the same dashboard but view different KPIs in their browser.
