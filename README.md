# Visual KPI Documentation

Welcome to the Visual KPI Documentation repository. This documentation project is powered by Docusaurus, providing a user-friendly and organized platform for learning and reference.

## Project Organization

To contribute or request modifications and updates, please create an issue. When creating issues, be sure to assign relevant labels to facilitate project organization. You can find a list of existing labels [here](https://github.com/transpara/documentation/labels). Additionally, you have the option to create branches and assign collaborators to them.

All new issues are initially allocated to the "ToDo" column within the [Project](https://github.com/orgs/transpara/projects/19) board of the project repository.

## Branches Organization

The primary branch for this project is the **main** branch, from which documentation deployments are based. It's crucial to note that direct pushes to the main branch are **strongly discouraged**. Instead, for any modifications or updates, create a new branch with a descriptive name, and push all your commits to this branch.

Upon completing your work, whether it involves creating new documentation pages or enhancing the documentation's user experience, kindly request a review. After review and addressing any existing bugs or issues, your new branch will be merged into the main branch.

## Reponsabilities

The WriteChoice team takes responsibility for creating and maintaining the documentation. If you're creating an issue related to the documentation content, feel free to assign the issue to one of our WriteChoice members. Additional guidance and support will be provided in the future.
